StableVault is a simple decentralized application (DApp) built on the Arc Testnet that allows users to deposit USDC and earn a fixed 5% interest. It’s designed as a demo project to show how smart contracts can handle token deposits, interest rewards, and withdrawals securely using Solidity and Web3.js.

Users can:

* Connect or disconnect their wallet
* Deposit (stake) USDC
* View their total deposit and interest earned
* Withdraw their funds at any time


**Features**
- Deposit USDC → Earn 5% instant reward
- Withdraw anytime (principal + reward)
- Built with Solidity + OpenZeppelin
- Fully on-chain, no backend
- Works on any wallet


**Tech Stack**
- Solidity ^0.8.20
- OpenZeppelin (SafeERC20, ReentrancyGuard)
- Web3.js frontend
- Vercel hosting

The project uses a clean, futuristic Arc style interface and follows secure smart contract principles. It’s built for learning and exploration, a foundation for future upgrades like real yield farming or liquidity staking.
